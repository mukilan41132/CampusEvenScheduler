🎯 Goal

A system where students, faculty, and admins can create, view, manage, and register for college events.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React (with Material-UI or Tailwind for UI)

Backend: Java Spring Boot (REST APIs)

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL for flexible event structures)

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)

Deployment: Docker + Cloud (AWS / Render / Railway / Vercel for frontend)

📌 Roadmap
Phase 1 – Requirements & Planning

Identify user roles:

Admin: Create/approve/manage events

Faculty: Create/host events

Student: View/register for events

Define core features:

Event creation (title, description, date, venue, organizer)

Event listing & search/filter

Registration for events

Notifications/reminders

Admin approval workflow

Calendar view (month/week/day)




Phase 2 – Backend Setup (Java + Spring Boot)

Initialize Spring Boot Project

Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Security, JWT.

Database Models (MongoDB Collections)

User → { id, name, email, role, passwordHash }

Event → { id, title, description, date, time, venue, organizerId, status }

Registration → { id, eventId, userId, timestamp }

REST APIs

/auth/login – login with JWT

/auth/register – signup

/events (GET) – list events

/events (POST) – create event (faculty/admin only)

/events/{id}/register – student registers for event

/events/{id}/approve – admin approves event

MongoDB Integration

Use Spring Data MongoDB repositories for CRUD.

Phase 3 – Frontend Setup (React)

React Project Setup

Create React app with TypeScript (optional)

Install Axios, React Router, Material-UI/Tailwind

Pages/Components

Auth: Login, Register

Events:

Event List (search, filter, calendar view)

Event Details (description, organizer, venue)

Create Event (faculty/admin)

Dashboard:

Student: Registered events

Faculty: Created events

Admin: Pending approvals

State Management

Context API or Redux Toolkit for authentication & global state.

API Integration

Use Axios to connect React → Spring Boot APIs.

Phase 4 – Features & Enhancements

Calendar View (React Big Calendar or FullCalendar)

Email Notifications (Spring Mail or Node microservice)

Event Reminders (scheduled jobs with Quartz or Spring Scheduler)

Search & Filters (by date, department, type of event)

File Upload (event poster, using AWS S3 or Cloudinary)

Phase 5 – Authentication & Security

JWT Authentication (login generates token, frontend stores in localStorage)

Role-based Access Control (Spring Security)

Password Encryption with BCrypt.

Phase 6 – Deployment

Backend: Deploy Spring Boot on AWS EC2 / Render / Railway.

Frontend: Deploy React app on Vercel or Netlify.

Database: Use MongoDB Atlas (cloud).

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for auto-deployment.

Phase 7 – Future Enhancements

Mobile App (React Native / Flutter using same APIs)

Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

Event Feedback & Ratings

Analytics Dashboard for admins (attendance, popular events)

⚡ Suggested MVP Timeline:

Week 1–2: Backend APIs (Auth + Event CRUD)

Week 3–4: Frontend UI (Event listing, create event, register)

Week 5: Authentication + Role Management

Week 6: Calendar View + Notifications

Week 7–8: Testing + Deployment
